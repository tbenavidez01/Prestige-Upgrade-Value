# Prestige-Upgrade-Value
I distract myself playing idle/incremental mobile and browser games.
They all run about the same way with prestiging giving a currency that increases production by a value per currency
While also have upgrades exclusively purchased with that same currency.
Comes the question: When is purchasing the next upgrade worth the lost in production from spending the currency?

A quick way to determine if and when spending prestige currency is and will be worth it.
